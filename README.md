# Verilog-implementation-of-MIPS-32-RISC-Processor
Behavioral Verilog code was developed to implement a pipelined version of a subset of MIPS-32 instructions, incor-
porating various addressing modes and following RISC design principles.
The processor utilizes a pipelined architecture with five stages for executing instructions which comprise of Instruc-
tion Fetch (IF),Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write-Back (WB).
